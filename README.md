###Overview of Election Audit
The purpose the election audit is to certify the congressional race for a precinct in Colorado and determine if Python would be more well suited to determining election results over Excel. This particular precinct includes three counties and three candidates for the office. Python is being utilized to determine how well it automates the tasks of counting the votes, calculating percentages, and determining the winner of the election amonst other things.

###Election Audit Summary
Python is certainly capable of handling large amount of data and sorting through it in an efficient manner. Other uses it could have for future elections is help find trends for candidates that run for a second (or multiple) terms, and perhaps also find trends based on political or party affiliation. It could also narrow down how many votes a particular person got in specific counties to measure the trends the individual counties follow.
